# CV Builder

A React app that allows users to create a basic CV.

Part of The Odin Project's [React JS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Learning Goals

The goal of this project was just to learn the basics of React. I built it first using class components, and then refactored it to use functional components with hooks. I did not take the time to do much styling for this project. 

I am pretty impressed with how easy it is to get basic functionality implemented with React vs. plain Javascript, and am excited to learn more! 
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
